When you unzip the code files, the folder the author-created folder structure may disappears. 
To preserve this structure, do the following: 
1.	Right-click the zip file and select WinZip and then Extract To.
2.	Place the directory structure wherever you want on your computer.
3.	Make sure that the Use Folder Names check box is checked.
4.	Click Extract.

This zip contains code from every chapter of the book with the exception 
of Chapter 5 and 14, and Appendixes A-C, and G-H. These chapters/appendixes
either have no code samples for download or have no downloadable code 
because the chapter has mostly line code snippets.

There are two loose files that are not included in any of the chapter files:
othello.xml and poem.xml. Because they are used in running examples in a
number of different chapters they are included for your convenience.

We hope you have fun with the sample code we have included and that 
you find it useful and informative. Enjoy.
