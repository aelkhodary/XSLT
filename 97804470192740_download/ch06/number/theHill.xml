   <title>The Hill</title>
   <stanza>
      <line>Breathless, we flung us on the windy hill,</line>
      <line>Laughed in the sun, and kissed the lovely grass.</line>
      <line>You said "Through glory and ecstasy we pass;</line>
      <line>Wind, sun, and earth remain, and birds sing still,</line>
      <line>When we are old, are old...." "And when we die</line>
      <line>All's over that is ours; and life burns on</line>
      <line>Through other lovers, other lips" said I,</line>
      <line>"Heart of my heart, our heaven is now, is won!"</line>
   </stanza>
   <stanza>
      <line>We are Earth's best, that learnt her lesson here.</line>
      <line>Life is our cry. We have kept the faith!" we said;</line>
      <line>"We shall go down with unreluctant tread</line>
      <line>Rose-crowned into the darkness!".... Proud we were,</line>
      <line>And laughed, that had such brave true things to say.</line>
      <line>-- And then you suddenly cried, and turned away.</line>
  </stanza>
