  <para>Back at the <venue>Wigmore Hall</venue> on <date iso="2007-03-27">27 March</date> another fine group, 
  the <artist>Carducci Quartet</artist>, was joined by pianist <artist>Nicola Eimer</artist> for a programme of 
  <composer>Mozart</composer>, <composer>Ravel</composer> and <composer>Schumann</composer>. Following the current 
  fashion for the chamber versions of <composer>Mozart</composer> concertos, the players opened with a lively and 
  shapely performance of his <work composer="Mozart" opus="K414">A major Concerto K414</work>. <composer>Ravel</composer>'s 
  <work composer="Ravel">Quartet</work>, which followed, received a kaleidoscopic performance, exquisite and restless, 
  pushing urgently through its constantly changing emotional landscape, the many tricky corners negotiated with 
  perfectly judged rubato. For all its beauty, this was a muscular reading. Their performance of 
  <composer>Schumann</composer>'s <work composer="Schumann" opus="44">Piano Quintet</work> was one of constant intelligence, 
  in which repeats and recapitulations were always re-examined.</para>
